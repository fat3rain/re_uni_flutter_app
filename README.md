# re_uni

My flutter last project for "project learning" at uni.
It's an app where you can try pass tests and read the lections from your admins.
Not complecated, not bloc-stated (will add soon)
## Future features:
Graph screen (aka MindMap) = > User can create some graphs with edges and compare them to paragraphs from lectures to simplify their experience.
